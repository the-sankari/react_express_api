# React Express API

This project is a simple application that uses Express.js in the backend to create a local server and handle JSON data. In the frontend, React.js is used to fetch data from the backend.

## Tech Stack

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) - A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) - A promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.
